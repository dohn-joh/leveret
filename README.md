# !!!WARNING!!!
Use these files at your own risk. I don't plan to write a build guide or bill of materials for these. These boards were prototypes for my own personal use. I will be releasing a unibody keyboard soon with a proper case, build guide, and silkscreen labels in a separate repo.

# MORE WARNINGS
- v1 is very challenging to build. I intentionally did not include the case files because this version is the earliest prototype with the most build complexity and flaws.
- Both v1 and v2 use reversible pcbs, and both versions lack informative silkscreen labels. If you're 100% decided on building this, then you'll need to reference the nets in the kicad files before soldering the mcu.
